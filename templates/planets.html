                <p>Ilum was a snow-covered planet located in the 7G sector of the Unknown Regions, within the Ilum system. Ilum was the fifth planet from its parent star Asar, a blue dwarf, located roughly equidistant from Asar and the system's cometary cloud. Ilum had a kyber crystalline core, and had been utilized by the Jedi Order for the Gathering, a rite of passage in which Jedi younglings had to find and harvest kyber crystals for their lightsabers, which had existed for thousands of standard years.                  When the Jedi Order was exterminated by order of Darth Sidious, the new Galactic Empire occupied Ilum and began excavating it for its vast supply of kyber crystals, which were to be used in the construction of the first and second Death Stars. The over-mining of the planet caused its core, and later a massive Imperial Trench, to open up along Ilum's equator.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-4">Dathomir</h3>
                <p>Dathomir, nicknamed the "rancor planet," was a remote, neutral and obscure planet in the Quelli sector and the home of the Nightsisters, Nightbrothers, Blue Coral Divers Clan, Singing Mountain, and the Howling Crag. The planet, bathed in blood-red light by its central star, had numerous continents that were overrun with vegetation, forests, and swamplands. The dark side of the Force had an immensely strong presence on Dathomir, which allowed for the nurturing of many malevolent Force wielders native to the planet. The Nightsisters, also known as the Dathomir witches, made their home in the swamps, and wielded magicks fueled by Dathomir's own power. Dathomir was also home to the Nightbrothers, Zabraks who were ruled by the Nightsisters. It was also the homeworld of the semi-sentient rancor species.</p>

                <p>Dathomir was a remote and uninviting world, although it was temperate and verdant, with a comfortable atmosphere despite its challenging ecosystem and dangerous predators. Perpetually bathed in a red mist, its terrain was one of contrasts, ranging from the murky swamps the Nightsisters lived in, to the harsh, barren rocks where the Nightbrothers found residence. Dathomir's natural inhabitants were well-adapted to the planet's harsh conditions and some, such as the rancor were famed for their combative skill</p>

            <p>Mandalore was a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. It was the homeworld of the Mandalorians, a fearsome warrior people who fought the Jedi and raided their temple during the fall of the Old Republic. Wearing distinctive armor that was often made from Beskar, they were feared throughout the galaxy, and had political influence over two thousand other star systems.Years of war left the planet inhospitable, forcing the Mandalorians to live within domed cities. A pacifist regime came to power at the end of these wars, led by Duchess Satine Kryze, while those who refused to give up their warrior ways were exiled to the moon Concordia. During the Clone Wars, the New Mandalorians were overthrown by the renegade Sith Lord Maul's Shadow Collective, though the Galactic Empire would rule the planet after the war's end.</p>
